ðŸ”¹ 1. Ticket Creation
ðŸ“Œ Screenshot: End-user submitting a ticket

Description:
This is the initial stage where an end-user reports an issue by submitting a ticket through the support portal. They provide key details such as the subject, issue description, department, and contact info. This step officially logs the issue into the ticketing system and generates a unique ticket number for tracking.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Ticket Classification and Assignment

Description:
Once a ticket is submitted, a help desk agent or technician classifies the ticket based on severity, urgency, and type of issue. The ticket is assigned to the appropriate department and team member. This ensures the right people are notified and responsible for resolution. SLAs (Service Level Agreements) are also set at this stage to define response/resolution time expectations.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Ticket Handling and Response
ðŸ“Œ Screenshot: Agent responding, ticket thread, or internal note

Description:
The assigned agent begins investigating the issue, communicating with the end-user, and performing troubleshooting steps. This stage includes all back-and-forth communication, internal notes, and updates made as the problem is worked on. Good documentation is key here, and all actions are tracked in the ticket history.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Ticket Resolution and Closure
ðŸ“Œ Screenshot: Ticket marked as Closed/Resolved, full ticket timeline

Description:
After the issue is resolved, the agent updates the ticket with final actions taken and marks it as closed. The user may be notified via email, and the ticket is archived for future reference. Proper closure ensures metrics like resolution time and customer satisfaction can be measured.
